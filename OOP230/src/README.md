# CISC 230 Project

This project holds deep sentimental value for me because it was one of the assignments I created during CISC 230, a course that marked a major turning point in my academic journey. CISC 230 wasn’t just another requirement to check off; it was the class where I truly began to understand how to code on a deeper level. It transformed the way I thought about programming, moving me from simply following along with examples to actually being able to solve problems independently and creatively.

When I first switched to a Computer Science major halfway through my first semester, I was excited but also extremely intimidated. I didn’t have any coding background, and as I approached summer break, I was filled with doubts. Would I be able to keep up? Could I really see myself succeeding in this major? To prepare, I spent the summer studying on my own, revisiting the fundamentals, and trying to build a stronger foundation. Enrolling in CISC 230 was a big part of that plan, and looking back, it was one of the best decisions I made.

This course challenged me in all the right ways. I was no longer just writing code that worked. I was learning how to write code that was thoughtful, organized, and efficient. With each assignment, I gained not only new technical skills, but also a sense of confidence that I hadn’t felt before. I started to see how coding could be both logical and creative, and I found genuine enjoyment in the process of building something from scratch and watching it take shape through lines of code.

Honestly, I could say the same thing about any project I completed in CISC 230. Each one felt like a meaningful step forward, whether I was learning about recursion or better programming practices. The class reinforced my decision to pursue Computer Science and helped me find my footing after a rocky start. It gave me the tools I needed to grow, and more importantly, it gave me the belief that I could succeed in this field.

In many ways, CISC 230 represents the moment where my Computer Science journey truly began. It was the class that bridged the gap between uncertainty and confidence, and every project I created in it reflects that transition.
