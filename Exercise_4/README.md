Portable Theremin

For my final project in the Creative Coding course, I created an interactive digital theremin using hand-tracking technology via a webcam. The program captures the positions of the user's pointer fingers in real time and maps those coordinates to control both the pitch and volume of a synthesized sound. By simply moving your hands in front of the camera, you can "play" the instrument. Higher positions on the screen correspond to higher pitches, while lateral movement can affect dynamics or timbre depending on the mode.

The inspiration for this project came from the traditional theremin, one of the earliest electronic instruments played without physical contact. I was intrigued by the idea of blending classical concepts of sound manipulation with modern tools like p5.js and ml5.js. Using these libraries, I was able to incorporate pose estimation into my code and generate a real-time sound environment that responds fluidly to human motion.

While the final product may not be the most advanced or complex version of a digital theremin, I am proud of what it accomplishes. It serves as a playful, interactive experience that can entertain for several minutes and demonstrates a strong integration of creative coding concepts. The process of debugging the hand-tracking, fine-tuning the pitch ranges, and ensuring smooth audio feedback taught me a great deal about real-time input and output systems and the challenges of building responsive, gesture-based interfaces.

This project represents a culmination of my learning throughout the semester. It challenged me to think not just like a programmer but like a digital artist, balancing technical implementation with aesthetic interactivity. It also sparked ideas for future projects involving gesture-based control, visual performance tools, or even accessibility-focused applications. Most importantly, it reminded me that creativity in code does not require complexity to be impactful. Sometimes, a simple interaction can be just as engaging and memorable.
