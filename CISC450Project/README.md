# CISC450Project

Project for Database design
This project let me practice the skills I learned in Database Design. With the help of my partner, we created a database from scratch and then integrated it into a locally hosted web page. The python code talks to the database and stores it in it. We created the frontend with the help of ChatGPT which was encouraged by our Professor.
