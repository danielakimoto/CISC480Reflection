# CISC480Reflection

This is my portfolio for CISC 480 - Senior Capstone. I selected 3 projects that I feel are a good representation of my time here in the CISC Department of St. Thomas. 

The CISC450Project is a project I created in Databse Design. It uses all the concepts we learned in class. In addition to that, it was created with the help of ChatGPT for the front end. This was encouraged by our professor as he wanted to see how useful the use of AI was in creating a project. However, this was limited to only creating the front end of the project. All other aspects of it had to be coded by the students. 

Exercise_4 is a project I created in Creative Coding. This file contains a handtracking portable theremin. Professor Keston encouraged students to be as creative as possible while also showcasing the various tools we learned about throughout the semester. My project features a handtracking web app that allows the user to pretend to play a theremin while only using a webcam. If I had more time, I could finetune the ptiches to make it so that you could actually play songs. There are options on it that make it easier for a user to play something that sounds good. 

OOP230 contains a project I created in CISC 230. I explain much deeper why this simple class meant so much to me in the README file in that project. Long story short, CISC 230 was a very impactful class for my Computer Science journey here at St. Thomas. Had I not faced that challenge, I would not have the skills I have today. It was a very big turning point in my personal life and academic career, so submitting a project from that class was a must for me.
